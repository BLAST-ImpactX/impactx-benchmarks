# ImpactX Benchmarks

This repo aims to provide automated benchmarks of ImpactX correctness/performance with other community codes.

This is still in early stages and will be cleaned up, developed more, and likely transiitoned to use [pytest-benchmark](https://pytest-benchmark.readthedocs.io).
Bear with us.
